\# Inter-Platform Node Communication



A cross-platform communication system enabling reliable data exchange between

Windows and Linux nodes using C and Java.



---



\## 📌 Overview



This project demonstrates successful \*\*inter-platform node communication\*\*

between heterogeneous environments (Windows ↔ Linux).  

It validates that independent nodes implemented in different languages and

running on different operating systems can communicate reliably using a

common protocol.



The project was built, executed, and tested on real systems (not simulations),

making it a strong demonstration of system-level programming and networking

concepts.
